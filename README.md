Iâ€™m passionate about connecting cutting-edge technologies, art, climate action, and social responsibility to tell powerful stories and communicate data creatively. With a diverse background in creative tech, journalism, and NGOs, I bring a unique perspective and skill set to every project. I also enjoy public speaking and empowering communities to take action. My latest project, <a href="https://soundofwar.art" target="_blank">Sound of War</a>, showcases the power of transforming news data about the war in Ukraine into music and interactive 3D visuals.
